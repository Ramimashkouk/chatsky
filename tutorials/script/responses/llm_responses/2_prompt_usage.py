# LLM: 2. Prompt Usage

Prompting is an essential step in using LLMs and Chatsky provides you with a simple way of using multiple prompts throughout your script.
The main idea behind that is the hierarchy of prompts. It can be portrayed as follows:
```
SYSTEM: SYSTEM_PROMPT
SYSTEM: GLOBAL_PROMPT
SYSTEM: LOCAL_PROMPT
SYSTEM: NODE_PROMPT

# history `n` turns
HUMAN: req
AI: resp

SYSTEM: RESPONSE_PROMPT
HUMAN: CURRENT_REQUEST
```

This way you can specify a certain prompt for each flow or node to alter the models behavior.

Let's create a simple script to demonstrate this. Note, that prompt should go the `MISC` field of the node. Inside `MISC` it can be stored under the `prompt` key, or under the `global_prompt` key (or `local_prompt` accordingly).
In the latter case it would not be overwritten by a _more local_ prompt.
