# LLM: 2. Prompt Usage

Prompting is an essential step in using LLMs and Chatsky provides you with a simple way of using multiple prompts throughout your script.
The main idea behind that is the hierarchy of prompts. It can be portrayed as follows:
```
SYSTEM: SYSTEM_PROMPT
SYSTEM: NODE_PROMPT
SYSTEM: GLOBAL_PROMPT
SYSTEM: LOCAL_PROMPT

# history `n` turns
HUMAN: req
AI: resp

SYSTEM: RESPONSE_PROMPT
HUMAN: CURRENT_REQUEST
```

This way you can specify a certain prompt for each flow or node to alter the models behavior.

# %% [markdown]
"""
Let's create a simple script to demonstrate this. Note, that prompt should go the `MISC` field of the node. Inside `MISC` it can be stored under the `prompt` key, or under the `global_prompt` key (or `local_prompt` accordingly).
Please note, that `MISC` is just a dictionary and its fields can be overwritten in any node, if given the same key. You can utilize this in your project, but below we present the intended way of using `MISC` for storing multiple prompts.
