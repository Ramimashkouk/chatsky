# JSON Import examples

This directory is temporary and will be removed.

The purpose of this directory is to showcase JSON Import capabilities of the DFF Pipeline.

Currently, it has two examples:
- JSON script
- YAML script

Both scripts are equal and are very basic.

In order to run them:
1. Install dff via `poetry install`.
2. Run pipeline via `python json_import_examples/yaml/pipeline.py`.

This will run a CLI interface. For information on how to set up a web interface
for the DFF Pipeline see the corresponding tutorials:
https://deeppavlov.github.io/dialog_flow_framework/tutorials/index_interfaces.html#web-api

Not Yet Implemented: an object containing a list of all object names from DFF.
